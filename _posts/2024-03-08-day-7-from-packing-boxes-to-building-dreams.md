It's been a roller coaster of a week. The initial euphoria of quitting my job has settled, replaced by a frantic scramble of logistics and technical challenges. While the daydreams of pristine beaches and epic adventures remain vivid, the reality of preparing for a year off has been… well, let's just say it's not all Instagram-worthy sunsets.

**The Logistics Labyrinth:**

Foremost on the agenda: logistics. Insurance, the bane of every responsible traveler, became my first hurdle. I researched and compared plans, ensuring I wouldn't be left high and dry in case of medical emergencies. And while I did my research, I realized that I faced two extra challenges: (1) I do not have a residence in my home country anymore, which is a requirement for many travel insurances and (2) I basically left my country already years ago so I had to sign up for the travel insurance from abroad, which required additional verification through the insurance company, more documents to submit and higher costs.

Next came the bittersweet task of letting go of my physical space. Scheduling furniture pick-up dates brought a pang of finality, as familiar pieces left my apartment, taking a chunk of my life with them. Arranging painting was luckily easier than I thought, since my landlord agreed to coordinate the process after I already moved to the sea side. However, I totally underestimated the time needed to pack up last stuff, leave all cupboards totally empty, do some deep cleaning of the apartment and cancel my internet contract (I obviously left all for the last day). Hence, when the time came up to hand over the keys to my landlord, I was basically still sweating while I was mobbing the floor.

##### **Lessons Learned (the Hard Way):**

Here are a few takeaways for anyone embarking on a similar journey:

* **Start early:**&nbsp;Don't underestimate the time required for logistics. Give yourself ample buffer time for research, paperwork, appointments, and unforeseen delays.
* **Create a Moving Checklist:** List down every task, from contacting movers to scheduling utility disconnections. This will help you stay organized and avoid last-minute scrambles.
* **Declutter ruthlessly:**&nbsp;Donate, sell, or dispose of anything you don't use or love. This will not only make packing easier but also free up mental space.
* **Label Everything:** Label and organize the things in your apartment by (1) Selling, (2) Donating and (3) Keeping so you have an overview in advance of which items you actually will keep. (I thought, its nothing, but then on the last day I faced too many things that did not fit in my suitcase anymore).


**New Skills Unlocked: Diving into the Digital World**

With the logistics of moving making me feel anxious and stressed, I decided to shift my focus to a more exciting part - learning and creating! In 2020, in the midst of the pandemic, I decided to learn a new skill -  Web Development. I participated in an immersive digital bootcamp with the *Institute of Code* in Bali and learnt everything I need to know about the world of HTML, CSS, Jekyll and CloudCannon. It was a steep learning curve, filled with moments of frustration where code refused to cooperate and the screen resembled a digital hieroglyph. But with each hurdle overcome, a sense of accomplishment washed over me.

While last year, I was lucky enough to be able to already code two real client projects, I felt like it's time for me to step up my game and dive fully into the world of web design and development. Hence, I decided to code at least 6 projects within the remaining of the year, built up a portfolio and practice, practice, practice… That's when the idea for this blog, the one you're reading right now, was born.

##### **Setting Goals for Growth:**

Looking ahead, I've set some specific goals to keep me motivated:

* **Develop strong content creation skills:** Writing engaging and informative posts requires consistent practice. Publish one blog post a week and probably start a corresponding social media account too (Instagram or Tiktok?)
* **Practice essential coding languages**: Besides coding this blog from scratch, the idea is to also develop at least 5 other web projects on the way.
* **Engage with the online community:** Connecting with other bloggers and web development enthusiasts can be a source of inspiration, collaboration, and problem-solving.
* **Explore different digital design areas:**&nbsp;Learning to use more tools of the Adobe Creative Cloud (Illustrator, Lightroom, Photoshop) or other tools like Figma will allow me to create captivating visuals and graphics not only for the blog.

**The Journey Unfolds:**

These goals are just a starting point. This year is all about exploration and learning, so I'm open to adapting and expanding my skillset as I go. Who knows, maybe I'll dive into photography, master video editing, or even learn a new language! The possibilities are endless. This blog is the first step, a digital passport that will document my journey through code, foreign lands, and personal growth.

**This blog, with all its imperfections and ongoing development, is a testament to that spirit of exploration. It's a platform to share my experiences, learnings, and hopefully, inspire others to pursue their own dreams.** **So, join me on this adventure!**
