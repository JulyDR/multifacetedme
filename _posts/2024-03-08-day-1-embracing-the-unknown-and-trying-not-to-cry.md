## Embracing the Unknown (and Trying not to Cry)

##### A Sabbatical Survival Guide

Today, the calendar flipped to a new chapter: the first day of my year-long sabbatical. 365 sunrises to explore, to grow, to simply **be**. One year. 365 days without the familiar routine, the fluorescent lights, and the comforting (or sometimes, mind-numbing) rhythm of corporate life. The emotions are a swirling of excitement, sadness, fear, and everything in between.

The past few weeks have been a whirlwind of emotions. Saying goodbye to my job of six years was like closing a chapter in a well-worn novel. The familiar faces, the shared routines, the comfort of knowing what came next – all gone, replaced by a blank page brimming with possibilities. The most challenging goodbyes were the ones whispered through tear-filled eyes.

Starting to pack wasn't just about organizing clothes and toiletries; each item holding a memory, a laugh, a tear. It was about revisiting past chapters, and saying goodbye to some aspects of my old life. Maybe that is the reason why I am doing the bar minimum right now, procrastinating every day by seeing friends or just watching Netflix, but not thinking of really starting the process of moving finally.

Those who know me are aware that this was the first time I was actually living for such a long time in the same place, having my own apartment, with my own furniture. And those who know me also know who much I struggle with saying goodbye, leaving people, places and things behind. So amidst the excitement, there were moments of intense vulnerability. Saying goodbye to loved ones was a heart-wrenching experience. Tears were shed, promises exchanged, and the weight of the unknown hung heavy in the air.

Fear, I discovered, is an unwelcome yet inevitable guest on the threshold of change. It whispers doubts, paints worst-case scenarios, and reminds us of the comfort (and sometimes, the monotony) of the familiar. What if I fail? What if I regret it? What if, after a year of chasing butterflies, I find myself as lost and empty-handed as I feel now?

For anyone considering taking a similar leap, know this: fear is a natural response to the unknown. It's not a reason to stay put, but rather a sign that you're about to embark on something significant. Here are a few things that helped me navigate the fear and embrace the unknown:

* **Acknowledge your feelings:**  Don't try to suppress the fear. Name it, recognize it, and understand it. Bottling up emotions can hinder your ability to move forward.
* **Talk it out:** Surround yourself with supportive friends and family who understand your decision and encourage you on your journey. Don't be afraid to reach out for their love, advice, and a listening ear when you need them most. Confide in trusted friends and family about your anxieties. (Big thanks to all my friends who listened to the same worries over and over again in the last months!)
* **Focus on the positive:** Remind yourself of the reasons you're taking this sabbatical. Visualize the experiences you're hoping to gain, the knowledge you'll acquire, and the personal growth you'll achieve.
* **Focus on self-care:** Taking care of yourself physically and mentally is crucial during this time of change. Prioritize healthy eating, regular exercise, and activities that bring you joy and peace. This will help you stay grounded and resilient as you navigate the challenges and uncertainties of the unknown.
* **Embrace the process:** This journey is not just about the destination; it's about the experiences, the lessons learned, and the personal growth you encounter along the way. Embrace the challenges as opportunities to learn and grow, and celebrate the small victories along the way.

So, here I am, on Day 1. As I write this, watching the sun set on this chapter, I feel a strange sense of peace. This journey, with all its uncertainties, is mine to explore. And while I might cry a little along the way, I know that the lessons learned and the experiences gained will be worth every tear.

This is just the beginning. Stay tuned for more adventures, misadventures, and everything in between! And to everyone out there contemplating a similar leap, remember: the greatest adventure is the one you haven't taken yet. So take a deep breath, embrace the fear, and take that first step into the unknown.
