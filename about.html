  <p class="bg-white p-5p">I am a curious soul in my mid-thirties who's currently on a year-long adventure of self-discovery. For the past six years, the Dominican Republic has been my vibrant home, where I've soaked up the sun, learned the language (somewhat!), and explored every hidden gem I could find.</p>

<!-- My Adventure -->
<section class=" text-center">
  <h4 class="text-4xl font-serif p-5p">Now, it's time for a new chapter!</h4>
  <p class="p-5p pt-0">I'm taking a break from the traditional work routine to figure out where life wants to take me next. This year is all about introspection, exploration (both geographical and personal), learning new skills, and prioritizing my well-being.</p>
  <div class="bg-cover bg-center bg-fixed min-h-30 p-5p flex items-center" style="background-image: url({{page.banner-image}})"></div>
  <p class="p-5p"><u>My Year Off:</u> The next twelve months will be a whirlwind! I'll be kicking things off in Cabarete, my Dominican home base, for the first 3 months. This kitesurfing haven will be the perfect place to practice my webdevelopment skills, join some yoga sessions and catching some epic waves.</p>
  <p class="p-5p">Then, with an open itinerary and a heart full of curiosity, i am heading back to my home country, Germany. I'll be chasing the European summer, visiting friends and soaking up the culture.</p>
  <p class="p-5p mb-4">The beauty of this year is the lack of a plan. This year is all about embracing the unknown (something that actually scares me a lot!). Join me as I learn, explore, and figure out what life has in store next!</p>

  <h4 class="mt-4 text-4xl uppercase font-serif"> My Passions!</h4>
  <p class="p-5p"><u>Learning:</u>I'm a lifelong learner, always hungry for new knowledge. This year, I'm diving headfirst into the world of web development and web design, figuring out if i can turn it into a future career. But I am also keen on learning about nutrition, finances or try out new sports (perhaps diving?).</p>
  <p class="p-5p"><u>Wellness:</u>Finding inner peace and maintaining physical health are key. You'll find me on my yoga mat, trying to master meditation (wish me luck!), or catching some waves while kitesurfing.</p>
  <p class="p-5p"><u>Adventure:</u>I crave new experiences and fresh perspectives. Whether it's exploring European cities, taking surf lessons or chasing waterfalls, I'm up for anything!</p>
